[ … TODO … ] 

[IMPORTANT]
include a ‘captcha’ in the application form to prevent spam/bots littering the db (use hcaptcha.com API), 
send a confirmation email to admin and candidate on application submission (use mailjet.com API)

[VERY IMPORTANT FOR FULL-FLEDGE WEBSITE]
and then in terms of even going beyond and sort of making this a full-fledged website:
1. you can create an admin login interface, so that we don't have to directly interact with the database, 
admins can log in and, check submitted applications, 
admins can add jobs, 
admins can delete jobs, 
2. admins can mark applications as accepted or rejected 
3. and users can also maybe login to check their application status,
4. Add SUSPEND Button in Admin page to suspend job posting being published as it could be attached to applications
